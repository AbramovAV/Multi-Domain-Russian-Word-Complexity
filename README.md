# Description
This repository contains code and all necessary data for running experiments on multi-domain lexical complexity estimation for words from Russian language. Currently it covers three main domains, corresponding to those described in paper [CompLex: A New Corpus for Lexical Complexity Prediction from Likert Scale Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07008):
- Bible (Source: [Russian Synodal Bible](https://github.com/christos-c/bible-corpus))
- Biomedical (Source: [Biomedical parallel corpus from WMT20](https://github.com/biomedical-translation-corpora/corpora))
- Socio-political (Source: [UN Parallel Corpus](https://conferences.unite.un.org/UNCORPUS))
